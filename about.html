      <h1>History</h1>
      <p>Godfrey was born in Wedza on the 5th of March 1975, and was educated at Mukamba Primary
      School in Buhera District. He is married and has two kids. There he was raised by his grandmother
      after his mother had passed away. His grandmother was the mother of the late great stone sculpting
      legend Nicholas Mukomberanwa. During the holidays he used to visit his uncles Nicholas
      Mukomberanwa, Nesbert Mukomberanwa and Albert Nathan Mamvura- during these visits he
      would play with sculpting tools as toys, this is when his passion for stone carving was birthed and
      subsequently nurtured.
      </p>
      <p>
      When he was in the 6th grade he was transferred to Chitungwiza, where he
      stayed with his father. He realised that he was talented in art the same year, after excursions with
      making wire crafts and wood carvings. As a young boy, he frequented his Uncle Albert Nathan
      Mamvura's workshop in Ruwa where he met a lot of the first generation Shona sculpture artists such
      as Sylvester Mubayi and many others who had a huge influence in the shaping of his career as an
      artist. In 2002, he moved to Nesbert's place, where he worked under his tutelage from 2002 to 2006.
    </p>
    <p>
      Godfrey started working on his own in 2007 with the help of the Mukomberanwa family, especially
      Nicholas Mukomberanwa who encouraged him to work independently. He loves creating unique
      pieces in different types of medium, particularly the hard type of stones such as springstone, opal,
      fruit serpentine, butter jade, lepidolite, cobalt and dolomite. He has participated in many
      exhibitions, competitions and workshops, of special mention is the Brock Awards first prize best
      sculpture he won in 2017 at Chitungwiza Arts Centre..
